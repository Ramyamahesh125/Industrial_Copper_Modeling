# INDUSTRIAL COPPER MODELING
Welcome to "Industrial Copper Modeling" Application! This platform is designed to address the challenges faced by the copper industry
in making accurate sales and price predictions.

# Key Challenges
# 1.Skewed and Noisy Data
Sales and pricing data can be heavily skewed and noisy, making manual predictions less reliable.

# 2.Optimal Pricing Decisions
Ensuring accurate pricing decisions in the presence of skewed data and outliers.

# 3.Lead Classification
Evaluating and Lead classifying leads to determine the likelihood of converting them into customers.



# Solution
# 1. Data exploration and Preprocessing
## Skewness and Outliers:
Explore and address skewness and outliers in the dataset.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Transform the data into a suitable format and perform necessary cleaning and preprocessing steps.

# 2. Machine Learning Models
## Regression Model:
Predict the continuous variable Selling_Price using a robust regression model.

## Classification Model:
Predict the lead Status (WON or LOST) to help capture potential leads effectively.

# 3.Features
## Selling Price Prediction:
Enter the relevant data for various features, and our regression model will predict the selling price accurately.

## Lead Status Prediction:
Input the necessary details, and our classification model will predict whether the lead status is WON or LOST, helping you prioritize leads better.
